    <string name="About">   Hi! We are Sandru Sebastian and Paul Iusztin, two individuals
        with passion for creating and designing software products for people. We truly
        believe that throw software we can help peoples live.\n
            This app is design to help us to pour out all our thoughts without feeling judged.
        When we go to a psychologist we think that they only say what we want to hear because we pay
        them. This is not the case. We want normal people to help each other. To communicate and help
        each others as we are meant to be, as human beings. Not to be helped only for money,
        but for compassion.\n
            We began to develop mobile applications as a hobby, nothing more. This is our first major
        project we have been working on, we do not expect nothing in back, but
        satisfaction for the usage of our app.</string>

    LowkeyHelp Terms of Service


Last Modified: October 31th 2018 (archived versions)


First, the legal stuff


In order to provide our Services (as defined below) through our apps, services, features, software, or website, we need to obtain your express agreement to our Terms of Service (“Terms”). You agree to our Terms by registering, installing, accessing, or using our apps, services, features, software, or website.


Please read the agreement carefully. By using our site or our app, you acknowledge that you have read, understood and agreed to be bound by the terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement and the privacy policy. If you do not wish to be bound by this Agreement and the privacy policy, you are not authorised to use our site or our app.


Welcome to LowkeyHelp. LowkeyHelp Ltd (“LowkeyHelp”, “we”, “our”, “us”) offers visitors (“you” or “your”) the ability to: (1) create personal questions and receive coaching for friends, family, and the public; and (2) coach, comment, discuss, and review results. This agreement (the “Agreement”) sets forth the terms and conditions which govern your use of the LowkeyHelp app (“our app”). It is LowkeyHelp Ltd. (collectively, “LowkeyHelp,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) that provides the services described below to you (collectively, “Services”):


Your Access to LowkeyHelp


Your Access. Without advance notice and at any time, we may, for violations of this agreement or for any other reason we choose: (1) suspend your access to LowkeyHelp, (2) suspend or terminate Your Account, and/or (3) remove any of your User Content from LowkeyHelp. We reserve the right to monitor LowkeyHelp, and your use of the Service means you agree to such monitoring. At the same time, we do not guarantee we will monitor at all.


Connecting You With Other People. We provide ways for you to communicate with other LowkeyHelp members through our peer to peer community. At LowkeyHelp you can share the ups and downs of life in a safe environment. We started LowkeyHelp with the belief in social connection and the power of evidenced-based peer to peer support. If you are in danger or require emergency support, please don’t hesitate to contact emergency services. LowkeyHelp is not to be used if you are in danger or a crisis situation.


Posting and Commenting. At LowkeyHelp, you can post whatever is on your mind as long as it stays within our Guidelines For Use. Members from around the world will then share advice or react and if they can, offer peer support. You can also support others through a peer-based community. At times, LowkeyHelp volunteers or admins will post or comment in a non-clinical capacity. You will use LowkeyHelp for entertainment or informational purposes only. You will not make critical decisions based on feedback from the LowkeyHelp community or experts in the LowkeyHelp community;


LowkeyHelp is Not Intended To Replace Professional Support. We firmly believe in the power of peer support, however, in lots of situations peer support is not appropriate and should not be used as a replacement for professional support or information from your GP/medical professional.


Personal Use. Our app are for your personal use only and shall not be used by you directly or indirectly in connection with any academic, commercial or governmental endeavour. If you would like to advertise, conduct market research or other survey or research activities for academic, commercial or political purposes please contact us by email at fusionkey@aol.com. LowkeyHelp does not have any affiliation with third-party mental health professionals using the service and it is strictly not intended as a marketplace to promote mental health services, therapeutic services, professional healthcare and support or any diagnostic services. LowkeyHelp reserves the right to remove any such content without notice.

We analyze how you make use of LowkeyHelp , in order to improve all aspects of our Services described here. LowkeyHelp uses the information it has and also works with partners, research partners, service providers, and affiliated companies to do this.


Safety And Security. We work to protect the safety and security of LowkeyHelp by appropriately dealing with abusive people and activity and violations of our Terms. We prohibit misuse of our Services, harmful conduct towards others, graphic or explicit content and violations of our Terms and policies, and address situations where we may be able to help support or protect our community. We develop automated systems to improve our ability to detect and remove abusive people and activity that may harm our community and the safety and security of our Services. If we learn of people or activity like this, we will take appropriate action by removing such people or activity or contacting law enforcement. We share information with other affiliated companies when we learn of misuse or harmful conduct by someone using our Services.


Enabling Global Access To Our Services. To operate our global Service, we need to store and distribute content and information on servers and systems around the world, including outside your country of residence. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by our service providers.


Crisis Support. LowkeyHelp is not a crisis support service and we cannot support users who are suicidal. If someone is in need of immediate support we urge them to contact the emergency services or one of the resources listed in our help centre. We are unable to provide crisis support through LowkeyHelp. As such we do not allow posts that actively discuss suicide attempts or methodologies.
