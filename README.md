## Android App for Psychologists & Patients

It is a mediator app between psychologists and patients. The goal of the app is to create a profile of the patient and match him with the best-suited psychologist.

Written in `Java` in `Android Studio`.
The apps main features are:
 * create a user profile ( either Psychologist or Patient)
 * rating system for Psychologist
 * matching system between a Psychologist & a Patient
  
  We used a `serverless` backend with `aws lambda` functions & `DynamoDB`.
